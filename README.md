## Summary
This is a Java program using the greedy algorithm to achieve the horse riding board. 
I study at the sophomore data structure, data structures and algorithms was very interested, so the combination of Java GUI created a chessboard horse riding program. The program using the greedy algorithm, each time you select the direction of the current eight coordinates at least the next alternative paths as the next step, which is locally optimal solution.

## Features
1. Greedy algorithm.
2. Java GUI program.
